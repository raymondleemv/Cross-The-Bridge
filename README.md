# Cross The Bridge

Cross the bridge is a logical thinking game and you have to transport all the passengers on one side of the bridge to the other side under certain constraints.

There are 3 policemen and 3 criminals. If at any instance there are more criminals than the policemen, the criminals will beat up the policemen and you lose. It is assumed that criminals will not run away even in the absence of policemen.
